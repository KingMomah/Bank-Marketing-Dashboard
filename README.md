- Most clients **did not have a loan** (84%) or **credit default** (98%).
- Despite high contact numbers, the conversion rate (term deposit subscription) was relatively low.

## 💡 Business Recommendations
1. **Refine Targeting**: Focus on professions like *management* and *technicians* which have higher conversion potential than blue-collar roles.
2. **Leverage Previous Success**: Clients previously contacted with *"success"* outcomes are more likely to subscribe. Re-target this segment.
3. **Optimize Call Resources**: Reduce contact attempts to profiles with high failure history from previous campaigns.
4. **Cross-Sell Products**: Use data on clients with loans or housing to tailor related product offers.
